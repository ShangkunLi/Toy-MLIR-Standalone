# Toy Tutorial - Standalone Version

## Basic Descriptions
This contains sample code to support the tutorial on using MLIR for
building a compiler for a simple Toy language.

See [docs/Tutorials/Toy](../../docs/Tutorials/Toy) at the root of
the project for more informations.

If you have built your LLVM/MLIR project but forget to buid the toy tutorial language provided by MLIR, you can simply use our project to build it independently!
